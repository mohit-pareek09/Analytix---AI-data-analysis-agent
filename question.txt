These test local shortcuts (no LLM call):

What columns are present in this dataset?

How many rows are in this dataset?

Tell me the no of columns

📊 ⚡ HISTOGRAM TOOL TESTS

These test plot_histogram (hist_age.png, etc.)

Plot a histogram of age

Plot a histogram of weight with 15 bins

Visualize the height distribution

Create a histogram of score

🧹 ⚡ CLEANING TOOL TESTS

These test clean_feature:

Clean the column weight

Remove missing values from height

Fix all NaN values in the score column

Clean the age feature

📈 ⚡ CORRELATION TOOL TESTS

These test calculate_correlation:

Calculate the correlation between age and score

Find the correlation between weight and height

Is there any relation between height and score?

Calculate the correlation between weight and age

🧠 ⚡ SMART QUESTIONS (LLM must choose correct tool)

These force the model to think and pick a tool:

Which feature is most closely related to age?

Show me something interesting from this dataset using any tool.

Is there a strong relationship between two variables here?

Visualize whatever feature you think is informative.

🧨 ⚡ ERROR / EDGE CASE TESTS

These help verify error-handling logic:

Plot a histogram of abcdef


(should return "Column not found")

Clean the column hello

Calculate the correlation between height and abc
